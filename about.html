<h2>What is RACHEL?</h2>
<p>
RACHEL, the Remote Area Community Hotspot for Education and Learning is a
combination of freely available software and content modules that make it easy
to bring online educational materials into places with limited or no internet
access. The content is available in multiple languages and can be customized to
suit local needs.
</p>


<h2>Who makes RACHEL?</h2>
<p>RACHEL was originally developed by Norberto Mujica when he saw the need
while visiting rural schools in Guatemala. It is now developed, supported, and
installed by the non-profit
<a href="http://worldpossible.org/">World Possible</a>
as part of their ongoing efforts to improve education in underserved schools.
</p>


<h2>Who uses RACHEL?</h2>
<p>You, right now! Also, tens of thousands of learners around the world, in
schools or communities that lack sufficient internet access. There are
RACHEL users in countries on just about every continent, with more getting
access every day.</p>


<h2>Where can I get RACHEL?</h2>
<p>RACHEL can be built from scratch using free software and off-the-shelf
hardware. You can learn more about it online at:
<a href="http://rachelfriends.org/">rachelfriends.org</a>.
You can also purchase pre-configured RACHEL servers from our online store
at: <a href="https://racheloffline.org/">racheloffline.org</a>.
All proceeds go back into the non-profit World Possible, which develops,
supports, and installs RACHEL.</p>


<h2>What browsers can be used with RACHEL?</h2>
<p>Our goal is to make RACHEL as compatible as possible, so it should work with
most browsers in common use, including many older ones. If you are looking to
install a new browser, Chrome is a popular choice because it is fast,
lightweight, and includes robust support for video and flash content. You can
download Chrome from Google at:
<a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/">www.google.com/chrome/browser</a>.</p>
